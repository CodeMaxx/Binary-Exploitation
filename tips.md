# Tips and Tricks

#### Finding string offsets for ret2libc attack

`strings -a -t x /lib32/libc-2.24.so | grep /bin/sh`

#### The ever forgetful `test` instruction

The TEST instruction performs a bitwise AND on two operands. The flags SF(Sign Flag a.k.a. Negative Flag), ZF(Zero Flag), PF(Parity Flag) are modified while the result of the AND is discarded. The OF(Overflow Flag) and CF(Carry Flag) flags are set to 0, while AF(Auxillary Carry Flag) flag is undefined. There are 9 different opcodes for the TEST instruction depending on the type and size of the operands. It can compare 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit values. It can also compare registers, immediate values and register indirect values.

The Sign Flag(Negative Flag) is set to the most significant **bit** of the result of the AND. In two's complement, a number with most significant bit = 1 is negative. If the result is 0, the Zero Flag is set to 1, otherwise 0. The Parity Flag is set to the bitwise XNOR of the least significant **BYTE** of the result i.e. if the number of 1s in the least significant byte is even, then the PF is set to 1 else 0.
